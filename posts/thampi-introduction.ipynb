        "[Thampi](https://thampi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) takes care of the DevOps work for machine learning prediction systems. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Data scientists(most of us, actually) want to focus on training their models. We just want the banana but find an entire gorilla holding on to it. **DevOps**. *Our models are useless unless they are deployed to production*. Building prediction servers is hard and often fledgling data science teams(mostly fledgling data science person) have to grapple with so many difficult questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cloud or On Premise?\n",
        "* How to use Docker?\n",
        "* How do I create a web server?\n",
        "* What about scaling and server failures?\n",
        "* I use Mac but we have to create the server in Linux?\n",
        "* Security updates, OS patches etc.\n",
        "* Kubernetes? *Ahhh… just shoot me*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "[Thampi](https://thampi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an attempt to take care of the DevOps work required for prediction systems. With Thampi, you have:\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Minimal Devops*. With a single command, create a web server that scales, is fault tolerant and zero maintenance(courtesy [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa)).\n",
        "* Focus on your model. Work in Python to train your model. Then wrap your model in a class which inherits from `thampi.Model` and Thampi takes care of the rest.\n",
        "* Pip and restricted Conda support.\n",
        "* **Work on any platform***. Work on Mac(technically possible on other platforms but untested) and still deploy to AWS Lambda(which is Linux). As you know, if one’s working on Mac, one can’t just upload the machine learning libraries(e.g. scikit-learn) to a Linux server. That’s because most machine learning libraries, for performance reasons, are written in C and these C extensions are compiled to OS specific binaries.\n",
        "* Thampi alleviates this by using Docker underneath so that you can work on a Mac(or Windows?). When serving the model, it recreates your machine learning project in the docker image(which is Linux) and compiles all the C libraries(e.g. scikit-learn) for you to Linux binaries, which is then uploaded to AWS Lambda.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s use the Iris dataset provided within scikit-learn. Let’s create a new project `myproject`. We’ll use `scikit-learn` as an example but you could use any framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Setup(Pip)\n",
        "\n",
        "```{shell}\n",
        "mkdir myproject && cd myproject\n",
        "virtualenv -p python3 venv\n",

So, let’s manually create a requirements file with the above dependencies as shown below and save it as `requirements.txt`. The versions will change but you get the idea.\n",

Each project(model) is at a different prefix so as long as the projects have unique names, they won’t overwrite each other. If you aren’t confident of that, you could just give a different bucket for each thampi project.\n",

You’ll note that some defaults have been filled up which are suitable for machine learning projects. A notable setting is `keep_warm` which prevents AWS Lambda from evicting the instance due to lack of use, by pinging the lambda(e.g. every 4 minutes). This is useful in the case when you have very large models. However, you could take it out if you feel that your model is small enough. For more details on how you can customize `zappa_settings.json`, check out [zappa docs](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa#advanced-settings)\n",
        "* Within `zappa_settings.json`, `thampi` adds a key `thampi`. All `thampi` specific settings will go here. Note: `zappa` has no idea of thampi. It’s just a convenient place to store the thampi relevant configuration.\n",

The data sent to the serving endpoint will be passed by thampi to the `predict` method as `args`. Likewise, one can wrap models of other libraries as well. Ignore the `context` argument in the `predict` method for now.

        "\n",

        "* Conda support is only for dependency files [crafted by hand](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually)\n",
        "* Max 500MB disk space. Ensure that your project with it’s libraries is below this size.\n",
        "* Max 900 MB model size. This number was derived from a few live tests. We circumvent the 500 MB disk space limit by loading the model directly from S3 to memory. thampi tries to reduce repeated calls to S3 by using zappa’s feature of pinging the lambda instance every 4 mins or so(configurable). In that way, the model will stay on the lambda instance(unless it’s a first time load or if AWS Lambda does decide to evict the instance for other reasons)\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on feedback, an option could be added to package the model with the code but you’ll then have to have a very small model size. It depends on what framework you use but generally you may have 100–250 MB space for your model as machine learning libraries take up a lot of space. Also look at the section on [Design](https://thampi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Alternatives\n",
        "\n",
        "#### AWS Sagemaker\n",
        "\n",
        "AWS SageMaker has the following advantages(not exhaustive):\n",
        "\n",
        "* If you have SLAs, then Sagemaker may be a good choice. As they are on demand instances, you won’t have the cold start delays.\n",
        "* GPU Inference available\n",
        "* Can serve models bigger than 1 GB(upon filling a form)\n",
        "* You can choose more powerful machines than what AWS Lambda can offer you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sagemaker has the following costs(correct me if I am wrong):\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have to deploy a model which is not supported by Sagemaker(e.g. lightfm), then you have to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* create your own docker image(manage your own OS updates e.g. security)\n",
        "* implement a web server which has to implement a few endpoints\n",
        "* manage auto scaling,\n",
        "* provide handlers to SIGTERM and SIGKILL events\n",
        "* manage some environment variables.\n",

        "#### Algorithmia\n",
        "\n",
        "[Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/) is a commercial alternative to Thampi. I’m not sure though how easy it is to deploy models on libraries not supported by Algorithmia(e.g. lightfm). Note: I haven’t spend too much researching Algorithmia.\n",
